# About
___
Paras helps you to create personal landing page in just a minute, super fast without hassle. Strip out the complicated part of website builder, leaving only a few important options for you to set up your personal site.

Paras was built on top of ExpressJS, NextJS and Radiks. Currently Paras only support handlebars-based template, later on we are going to support more modern template such as React and Vue.

Paras use Blockstack for authentication & storage so that users truly own their data, we also planning on developing the self-hosted version which will give you the full ownership of your website, not only the data.
